# 1.Gmail Sender
  ## Most of the we want to send same infromation to multiple people through email.
      so i create a small script where we are sending only the text to multiple people .
   
# 2.Sending using number 
  ## Kind of same idea but through number
    To do this i used 3 party API .

### Improve to be done 
    ---> send picture,
    ---> create GUI 
    ---> make security strong
                       
#3.Tic Tac toe 
   ## Hope you all played this game it is implemented using Tkinter in python 
      here i used Tkinter as GUI and
      mainly we have def btnClick which is used for checking button clicked and change the player turn 
      def checkForWin()
           checks all winning condition
            if X win color with RED
            if O win color with BLUE
            if TIE color YEllOW
      def disablebuttin()
          disable button after win
      def reset()
          clear all text in button and player1 
      def quit()
          closes the GUI
          
   ## In Design 
      we have 9 button for board playing
              1 for Reset
              1 for Quit
   ##For Implemention 
      Just Ctrl + c
